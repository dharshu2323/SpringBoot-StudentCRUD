This is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application for managing student records. The project is built using 

ðŸŒŸReactjs
ðŸŒŸSpringBoot
ðŸŒŸH2 DataBase
ðŸŒŸPostman

The dependencies generated in this project are:


1.JPA Repository:Java Persistence API (JPA) is a specification for managing relational data in Java applications.It provides CRUD operations and query methods for interacting with a database.


2.H2 Database:In your Spring Boot application, you can configure H2 as a dependency and use it for storing and retrieving data.It is a online database.


3.Lombok:Lombok provides annotations like @Getter, @Setter, @NoArgsConstructor, @AllArgsConstructor, @EqualsAndHashCode, and others.


4.Spring Web:Spring Web is a part of the larger Spring Framework, providing features for building web applications and RESTful web services.

ðŸ‘‰H2 DataBase:
```
# H2 Database Configuration
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:testdb
spring.datasource.driverClassName=org.h2.Driver
spring.datasource.username=sa
spring.datasource.password=password
spring.h2.console.enabled=true
```

The @CrossOrigin annotation in Spring is used to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) support at the class or method level.

When you're building a web application with a  React on a different domain than your Spring Boot backend, you might encounter CORS issues. 

The @CrossOrigin annotation helps you control how your backend responds to cross-origin requests.
